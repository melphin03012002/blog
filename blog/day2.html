    <p class="para">Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "creator") 
        is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.[3] Architectural works, in the
         material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with
          their surviving architectural achievements.</p>

     <h3 class="head1" align="center">DEVELOPMENT:</h3>
     <p class="para">Architecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed 
         from trial and error to successful replication. Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied 
         with building religious structures and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers 
         until Greek and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. Indian and Chinese architecture 
         influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist architecture in particular took diverse local flavors.
